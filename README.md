Ludo, one of our cherished childhood board games, holds a special place in our hearts. Its simple yet engaging gameplay has provided countless hours of fun and bonding. However, as times have changed, so have our ways of enjoying these nostalgic pastimes. Today, children often experience classic games like Ludo through smartphones and gaming consoles, losing the physical gameplay and interpersonal connection of traditional board games.
What if we could bridge the gap between the old and the new by creating a digital version of the Ludo board? So let's create a Digital Ludo Board, a modern take on this classic game that combines the nostalgia of the physical game with the convenience and interactivity of the digital world. Designed and built from scratch, this is not only a fun project but also an opportunity to try out the new multicolour PCB.
